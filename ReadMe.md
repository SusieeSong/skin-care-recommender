#CS410 Text Information System Project -- Skin Care Recommender
We developed a specialized search engine for skin care products on Amazon. The user can input some keywords of the effect they hope the product can achieve, such as “brightening serum” or “moisturizing cream”, and our system will return several top rated products based on the reviews related to this effect. Basically, this is a information retrieval system based on the content and the rating of the product reviews rather than simply basing on the products’ name or products’ introduction.

Below is the documentation for details
